	<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
	<p class="lead">Please read this before participating!</p>
      </div>

      <p>All participants in the Forte Labs Community are required to comply with the following Code of Conduct. Administrators (see below for definition of administrators) will enforce this code throughout the Forte Labs Slack, Forum, and other locations or events.</p>
      <h2><strong>The Short Version</strong></h2>
      <p>Be respectful of other people; respect privacy; and if you are having a problem then contact the Administrators. If you are being a problem, it will be apparent and you may be asked to leave the Forte Labs Community.</p>
      <h2><strong>The Long Version</strong></h2>
      <h3><strong>Respect</strong></h3>
      <p>The Forte Labs Community is an intentionally positive community that recognizes and celebrates the creativity and collaboration of independent members and the diversity of skills, talents, experiences, cultures, and opinions that they bring to our community.</p>

      <p>The Forte Labs Community is an inclusive environment, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender or gender identity (including transgender status), sexual orientation, age, disability, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or career path.</p>

      <p>We value respectful behavior above individual opinions.</p>

      <p>Respectful behavior includes but is not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.</li>
	<li>Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.</li>
	<li>If you're not sure, ask someone instead of assuming. No, really. Just ask the administrators. We'd rather hear from you than hear about something you said or did after the fact, and we are here to help.</li>
	<li>Don't be a bystander. Role model respectful behaviour, but also help to address disrespect when you see it.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Disrespectful behavior outside this community may be considered a violation of this code of conduct at the discretion of the Administrators.</p>

      <p>If you experience disrespectful behavior toward yourself or anyone else and feel in any way unable or unwilling to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to the attention of an Administrator. We want to hear from you about anything that you feel is disrespectful, threatening, or just something that could make someone feel distressed in any way. We will listen and work to resolve the matter.</p>

      <p>If the Administrators determine that someone is violating any part of this Code of Conduct, the Administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion and exclusion from the Forte Labs Slack, Forum, and other venues.</p>
      <h3><strong>Privacy</strong></h3>
      <p>This community is not a public space. However, no one has signed a non-disclosure agreement ("NDA") to participate, and you should not presume anything you say here will remain private, so act accordingly. Protect IP and legally-protected information.</p>

      <p>If you want to publicly disclose anything discussed here, use the <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule"> Chatham House Rule</a> as the guideline ("participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed").</p>
      <h3><strong>Administrators</strong></h3>
      <p>The administrators of Forte Labs Community as of March 29th, 2018:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Tiago Forte, <em>Founder</em></li>
	<li>Ben Mosior, <em>Director of Operations</em></li>
	<li>Corey Padnos, <em>Head Coach</em></li>
